## Project Overview
This repository is used to manage and track the progress of my undergraduate
dissertation project using Scrum and agile project management principles.

It provides structured planning, task tracking, and progress monitoring across
all stages of the dissertation lifecycle, aligned with CMP600 requirements.

---

## Project Scope
The Scrum board and GitHub issues in this repository cover the following areas:

- Dissertation proposal development and submission (CMP600)
- Ethics approval documentation
- Literature review
- Design and development of a simple chatbot prototype (artefact)
- Data collection using anonymous questionnaires
- Data analysis
- Dissertation writing, reflection, and final submission

---

## Prototype (Artefact)
As part of this dissertation, a simple, non-clinical chatbot prototype or
simulated chat interface will be designed and developed.

The prototype will support short, neutral interactions and will include clear
on-screen transparency and privacy messages (e.g. research purpose, no personal
data collection, no message storage). The prototype is intended as a research
artefact rather than a full production system.

---

## Project Management Approach
The project follows an iterative, Scrum-based approach. Work is organised into
clearly defined sprints, each represented by milestones with associated tasks and
deadlines aligned to the academic timetable.

GitHub Issues are used to represent individual tasks, while GitHub Projects
provides a Scrum board with the following columns:
Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Review, and Done.

---

## Ethics and Data Collection
Primary data will be collected using an anonymous, questionnaire-based approach.
No personally identifiable or sensitive participant data will be collected.

Ethical approval documentation, including participant information and consent
forms, is completed in accordance with university guidelines and data protection
requirements. No participant data is stored in this repository.

---

## Supervision and Log Book
Project progress is supported through regular supervision meetings. A minimum of
six supervision meetings will be held during the project.

A log book is maintained and updated after each meeting to record progress,
feedback, decisions, and agreed actions, supporting reflective practice and
project management.

---

## Tools Used
- GitHub Issues
- GitHub Projects (Scrum Board)
- Microsoft Word (formal academic documentation)

## Notes
This repository is intended solely for academic project management purposes.
It does not contain dissertation drafts or participant data.
